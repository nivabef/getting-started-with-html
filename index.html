<h1>I should have taken better notes</h1>

<h3>...but of course I think I already knew the things presented.</h3>

<br>
<b><em>Thinking like a programmer</em></b>
<p>1. Procedural thinking: step 1, step 2, step 3
<br>2. Abstract thinking: 1+1=2, whether is is apples or oranges or houses you're counting.
<br>3. Technical empathy: Thinking like a computer.
<br>4. Systems thinking: Breaking down big ideas into pieces.
</p>

<b><em>HTML - hypertext markup language</em></b>
<p>
  HTML elements are pieces of HTML documents. They are indicated with HTML tags.
</p>
<P>
  Unlike humans, computers can't mentally fill in gaps if there are errors or information missing.
  A human has to be very careful there are no mistakes when giving directions to a computer.
</P>
<p>
  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside them.
